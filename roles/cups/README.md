# cups

Sets up [`CUPS`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CUPS) on the users
machine and installs any printer drivers needed.

Note that to add printers via the GUI, you need to either authenticate as `root`
or be a member of the `cups` group (which means you will need to log back in
and out to benefit from these changes).
