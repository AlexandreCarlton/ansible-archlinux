# Normally pam_snapper is supposed to:
# - create a pre- and post- snapshot on login
# - create a pre- and post- snapshot on logout
# However, systemd-user is a bit weird since it doesn't trigger pam_snapper on logout, and pam_snapper never makes the post-snapshot.
# So we call 'openonly' to make a single snapshot on login.
